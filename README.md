Green Product Recommendation Engine
📘 Overview

The Green Product Recommendation Engine is an AI-driven system designed to recommend eco-friendly and sustainable products to consumers. By analyzing synthetic user preferences, product attributes, and sustainability scores, the model helps promote conscious consumerism and supports environmental responsibility.

🚀 Features

🧠 AI-Powered Recommendations: Suggests products based on sustainability metrics and user profiles.

🌍 Sustainability Scoring: Evaluates each product on eco-friendliness factors (carbon footprint, recyclability, energy efficiency).

📊 Data-Driven Insights: Generates analytics from synthetic data to simulate real-world consumer patterns.

🔍 Custom Filtering: Users can filter products by categories such as organic, renewable, or low-emission.

🧩 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas — Data manipulation

numpy — Numerical operations

scikit-learn — Recommendation modeling

matplotlib — Visualization

faker — Synthetic data generation

🧠 How It Works

Synthetic data is generated for users and eco-friendly products.

The model computes similarity scores between user preferences and product attributes.

Recommendations are generated based on sustainability and preference alignment.

The results can be exported to Excel for analysis.
